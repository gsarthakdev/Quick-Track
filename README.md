# âš¡Quick Track
Quick Track - The perfect solution for tracking/managing your expenses! All data is securely stored in real-time for user convenience through Google Realtime Database.
# ðŸ’»Technologies Used
â€¢ React Native in JavaScript

â€¢ CRUD operations through Google Firebase Realtime Database

â€¢ Axios for HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

â€¢ Context API for app-wide state

â€¢ React Navigation for app-wide navigation

# ðŸ“šMVC Design Pattern
This app implements the use of MVC architecture, in which the controller (logic in code) communicates with the model (Realtime Database) and view (React Native JSX).
This allows for a clean separation of concerns (SoC), and the ability to support multiple views with the application.

# ðŸ§ Agile Methodology
To develop this application I worked in sprints, meaning that I worked on one feature, tested it to verify if it works as expected, and then moved onto the
next sprint for the next feature. To track the progress of these sprints I used Jira.

Ultimately, I worked on developing each feature step-by-step with strict time frames and ensured high quality while working on that respective feature.
